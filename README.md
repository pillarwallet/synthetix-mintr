# PLR Rewards Dashboard

This is a fork of Mintr for the Pillar Wallet liquidity and incentives programme.

This is the code for the new Synthetix Mintr dApp: https://mintr.synthetix.io.

The dApp communicates with the [Synthetix contracts](https://developer.synthetix.io/api/docs/deployed-contracts.html), allowing users to perform the following actions:

- Mint (aka Issue) `sUSD` by locking `SNX`
- Claim rewards of both `SNX` (inflation) and `sUSD` (exchange fees) every week
- Burn `sUSD` to unlock `SNX`
- Transfer `SNX` to other accounts
- Deposit (or withdrawl) `sUSD` into the `Depot` contract, to go in the queue for exchanging with `ETH` at current market price

Mintr v2 supports the following wallet providers:

- Metamask
- Trezor
- Ledger
- Coinbase Wallet
